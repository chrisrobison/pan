**Features:**
- Contenteditable from/to sections
- Invoice number, date, due date fields
- Integration point for contact selection
- Broadcasts changes via PAN

**PAN Events:**
- Publishes: `invoice.header.changed`
- Subscribes: `invoice.load`, `invoice.clear`, `contact.selected`

### 2. `<pan-invoice-items>`
Editable grid for invoice line items.

**Features:**
- Click to add new rows
- Contenteditable cells (date, description, hours, rate)
- Auto-calculate line totals
- Delete rows
- Tab/Enter navigation

**PAN Events:**
- Publishes: `invoice.items.changed`, `invoice.totals.changed`
- Subscribes: `invoice.load`, `invoice.clear`

### 3. `<pan-invoice-totals>`
Displays and calculates invoice totals.

**Features:**
- Auto-updates from line items
- Editable tax rate
- Subtotal, tax, total calculations
- Notes/payment terms field
- Large, prominent total display

**PAN Events:**

### 4. `<pan-invoice-store>`
Centralized state management and persistence.

**Features:**
- localStorage persistence
- Multiple invoice management
- Auto-save with debouncing

## Architecture

### State Flow

```
User Edit ‚Üí Component ‚Üí PAN Event ‚Üí Store ‚Üí localStorage
                ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
             UI Update ‚Üê PAN Event ‚Üê Store
```

1. User edits a field (contenteditable)
2. Component emits change via PAN
3. Store receives change and updates state
4. Store saves to localStorage (auto-save)
5. Store broadcasts updated state
6. All components receive and sync

### Data Model

```typescript
interface Invoice {
  id: string;
  created: string; // ISO date
  modified: string; // ISO date
  header: {
    from: ContactInfo;
    to: ContactInfo;
    invoiceNumber: string;
    invoiceDate: string;
    dueDate: string;
  };
  items: LineItem[];
  totals: {
    subtotal: number;
    tax: number;
    taxRate: number;
    total: number;
    notes: string;
  };
}

interface ContactInfo {
  name: string;
  address: string;
  city: string;
  phone: string;
  email: string;
}

interface LineItem {
  id: number;
  date: string;
  description: string;
  hours: string;
  rate: string;
  total: number;
}
```

## Integration

### Adding Contact Selection

The invoice app is designed to integrate with a contact management system:

```javascript
// Listen for contact selector request
bus.subscribe('invoice.open-contact-selector', () => {
  // Show your contact selector UI
  showContactModal();
});

// Send selected contact
function selectContact(contact) {
  bus.publish('contact.selected', {
    name: contact.name,
    address: contact.address,
    city: contact.city,
    phone: contact.phone,
    email: contact.email
  });
}
```

### Custom Branding

Override CSS variables in your theme:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #your-brand-color;
}
```

### Adding PDF Export

The app currently exports to JSON. To add PDF export:

```javascript
// Using html2pdf.js or similar
document.getElementById('btn-pdf').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const element = document.querySelector('.main-content');
  await html2pdf().from(element).save('invoice.pdf');
});
```

## Extending

### Adding New Fields

1. **Update data model** in `pan-invoice-store.mjs`
2. **Add field to component** (header, items, or totals)
3. **Handle in PAN events**

Example - Adding a "PO Number" field:

```javascript
// In pan-invoice-header.mjs
<div class="field">
  <div class="field-label">PO Number</div>
  <div class="field-value"
       contenteditable="true"
       data-field="poNumber"
       data-placeholder="PO-12345">
    ${this._data.poNumber || ''}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Custom Line Item Types

Extend `pan-invoice-items` to support different item types:

```javascript
// Add item type column
<th class="col-type">Type</th>

// Add select or contenteditable for type
<td contenteditable="true" data-field="type">
  ${item.type || 'Service'}
</td>
```

### Advanced Calculations

Add discounts, fees, or complex calculations in `pan-invoice-totals`:

```javascript
_calculate() {
  const discount = this._subtotal * (this._discountRate / 100);
  this._subtotal = this._subtotal - discount;
  this._tax = this._subtotal * (this._taxRate / 100);
  this._total = this._subtotal + this._tax + this._fees;
}
```
