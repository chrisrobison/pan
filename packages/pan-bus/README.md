# @pan/bus

PAN Bus — DOM-native publish/subscribe with retained messages.

Usage:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.example/@pan/bus/index.js"></script>
<pan-bus></pan-bus>
```

This package is a thin wrapper around the reference `dist/pan-bus.js`. During publish, `index.js` is synced from the repo’s `dist` folder.
